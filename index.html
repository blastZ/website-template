        <p>Sherlock is a crime drama television series based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories.
             Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson.
             Thirteen episodes have been produced, with three-part series airing from 2010â€“2017, and a special episode airing on 1 January 2016.
             The series is set in the present day, while the one-off special features a Victorian period fantasy resembling the original Holmes stories.

              along with Hartswood Films, with Moffat, Gatiss, Sue Vertue and Rebecca Eaton serving as executive producers.
              The series is primarily filmed in Cardiff, Wales, with North Gower Street in London used for exterior shots

        <p>Sherlock depicts "consulting detective" Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) solving various mysteries in modern-day London.
           Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), who has returned from military service in
           Afghanistan with the Royal Army Medical Corps. Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves)
           and others are at first suspicious of Holmes, over time his exceptional intellect and bold powers of observation persuade them of
           his value. In part through Watson's blog documenting their adventures, Holmes becomes a reluctant celebrity with the press reporting
           on his cases and eccentric personal life. Both ordinary people and the British government ask for his help.
           Although the series depicts a variety of crimes and perpetrators, Holmes' conflict with nemesis Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) is a
           recurring feature. Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), a pathologist at St. Bart's Hospital, occasionally assists Holmes in his cases.
           Other recurring roles include Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson, Holmes and Watson's landlady, and series co-creator Mark Gatiss as Holmes' elder
           brother Mycroft.</p>
